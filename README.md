# AI-3P Framework: Readiness Scorecard

This repository contains the official Excel template for the AI-3P Framework, a practical scorecard for AI pre-deployment decisions. This tool is designed to accompany the blog post: **[AI-3P Pre-Deployment Framework | Bring Your Own Questions for AI Readiness Assessment](link)**.

## About the Framework
The AI-3P framework is designed to assess pre-AI adoption risks by evaluating new initiatives against the three core pillars in every organization: **People**, **Processes**, and **Products**. The goal is to make risks visible *before* hands-on implementation starts, helping to prevent common project failures that stem from issues with ownership, workflows, or change management rather than the technology itself.

## What's Inside

* **`AI-3P_Scorecard_Template.xlsx`**: The main template file. It includes the scoring logic and the example questions for all three pillars as detailed in the blog post.


## How to Use

1.  **Download the Template:**
    * Click on the `AI-3P_Scorecard_Template.xlsx` file in the file list above.
    * On the next page, click the **"Download"** button to save the file to your computer.

2.  **Bring Your Own Questions (BYOQ):**
    * The framework is designed for you to provide your own context-specific questions that aim to qualify your AI opportunities. The questions included in the Excel file are examples from the post and should be used as a starting point.

3.  **Score and Prioritize:**
    * Follow the methodology in the blog post to score each question for a potential AI use case. The scoring system is "no/unknown" (= 0), "partial" (= 1), and "yes/not applicable" (= 2).
    * The spreadsheet will automatically calculate the weighted **AI-3P Readiness Score** to help you prioritize your AI initiative and make a "go/no-go" decision.
